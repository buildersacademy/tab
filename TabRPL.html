<h1>Recognition of Prior Learning Information</h1>
<div class="accordionWrapper">
<div class="accordionItem close">
      <div class="accordionItemHeading"><i class="fa fa-award"></i> What
            is Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)?</strong></div>
      <div class="accordionItemContent">
          RPL is the acknowledgment of skills and knowledge obtained through
            learning achieved outside the formal education and training system
            and includes work and life experience including paid and volunteer
            work and skills attained through leisure pursuits such as musical,
            mechanical or linguistic abilities.
			<br><br>		
            RPL recognises any prior knowledge and experience and measures it
            against the qualification in which candidates are enrolled. The
            individual may not need to complete all of a training program if he
            or she already possesses some of the competencies taught in the
            program.<br>
            The Standards for Registered Training 
          <p>Organisations (RTOs) 2015 defines RPL as: </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>"an assessment process that assesses
              the competency/s of an individual that may have been acquired
              through formal, non-formal and informal learning to determine the
              extent to which that individual meets the requirements specified in the training package or VET accredited
              courses.</i></p>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> </div>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;" align="left"><em>a) formal learning
              refers to learning that takes place through a structured program
              of instruction and is linked to the attainment of an AQF
              qualification or statement of attainment (for example, a
              certificate, diploma or university degree);
			  <br><br>
              b) non-formal learning refers to learning that takes place through
              a structured program of instruction, but does not lead to the
              attainment of an AQF qualification or statement of attainment (for
              example, in-house professional development programs conducted by a
              business); and
			  <br><br>
              c) informal learning refers to learning that results through
              experience of work-related, social, family, hobby or leisure
              activities (for example the acquisition of interpersonal skills
              developed through several years as a sales representative)."</em></p>

    <div class="accordionItem close">
      <div class="accordionItemHeading"><i class="fas fa-question"></i> <strong>Why
            you should apply for RPL</strong></div>
      <div class="accordionItemContent">
If you apply for RPL and your application is
          successful you could:
          <ul>
            <li>reduce or eliminate the need for any training in skills and
              knowledge you already have</li>
            <li>save time by not needing to attend any or a reduced number of
              classes and completing unnecessary work</li>
            <li>save money because you will not have to buy textbooks and other
              learning material</li>
            <li>complete your qualification in a shorter time</li>
            <li>advance to a higher-level qualification in a shorter time if
              desired.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>RPL assessment enables individuals to forego training and move
            directly to having their competencies assessed, thus avoiding the
            need for unnecessary training that brings with it additional costs,
            including time and effort. Although it is not necessarily a quick or
            simple process, RPL aims to provide candidates who do not require
            formal learning with a flexible and faster way to have their skills
            and knowledge assessed against the competencies stipulated in
            Training Packages and vocationally accredited courses. Mature age
            jobseekers or existing workers with accumulated life and work
            experiences are seen as primary candidates for RPL.</p>

            of applying for RPL</strong></div>
      <div class="accordionItemContent">
RPL can be used in two ways:
          <ol>
            <li>As an alternative mechanism for gaining access to a course or
              qualification. A candidate may gain entry to a course or
              qualification using RPL as an alternative to be possessing the
              prerequisites for entry based on formal education and training. An
              example of this is a candidate who obtains a place in a diploma
              course using RPL (based on life or work experience) when they have
              not completed the relevant prerequisites; and/or</li>
            <li>For the award of unit/s of competency that form part of a
              qualification, leading to the partial or full completion of the
              requirements for that course or qualification.</li>

          with the general principles for RPL outlined below:
          <ul>
            <li>Information about RPL should be actively promoted, and
              accessible to a diverse audience of candidates</li>
            <li>RPL should recognise learning acquired in any context</li>
            <li>RPL assessment should be conducted according to the principles
              of assessment and in conformity with the rules of evidence</li>
            <li>There is no one RPL model that is suitable for all
              qualifications and all situations</li>
            <li>RPL processes should be timely, fair and transparent</li>
            <li>RPL assessment processes should be quality assured to the same
              level as training-based assessment</li>
            <li>RPL policies, procedures and processes should be explicitly
              included in quality assurance procedures within institutions</li>
            <li>RPL decisions should be accountable, transparent, and subject to
              appeal and review</li>
            <li>RPL assessment should be structured to minimise cost to the
              individual</li>
            <li>Institutions and providers should develop advice and information
              about RPL for employers of Candidates/potential candidates to
              promote RPL among employers</li>
            <li>Institutions and providers should include RPL in access
              strategies for disadvantaged groups</li>
            <li>Funding models should not impede the implementation of RPL.</li>

            for recognition</strong></div>
      <div class="accordionItemContent">
 To have skills formally recognised in the
          national system, assessors must make sure you have the skills and
          knowledge to meet the industry standard. This means you must be
          involved in a careful and comprehensive process that covers the
          content of all unit/s or qualification/s you can be recognised for.
        <br><br>
		Assessment happens in a variety of ways. Being
          prepared can save you valuable time and hassle and make the
          recognition process stress-free for you.
		  <br><br>
        When completing the application consider the below:
          <ul>
	<li>Talk about your job roles and your work history, where you have worked, either paid or unpaid, and what you did there.</li>
	<li>Your position description and any performance appraisals you have from any company you have worked in.</li>
	<li>Consider the possibilities for workplace contact. Are you in a workplace that is supporting your goals to get qualified? Would they provide you with references, would you feel comfortable to have the assessor contact your workplace or previous workplaces, so your skills can be validated? </li>
	<li>Think about who can confirm your current skill level. Think about current or recent supervisors who have seen you work in the past 18 months and will be able to confirm your skills. The assessor will need to contact them. You may also have community contacts or even clients themselves who can vouch for your skills level.</li>
	<li>Collect any certificates from in-house training or formal training you have done in the past.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
          </ul>

 This Candidate Booklet has been developed in line
          with the general principles for RPL outlined below: It is important
          that sensitive information is not included as part of your Supporting
          Documentation. You may need authorisation from your supervisor or
          manager to use some of your evidence, so it is always best to check
          the privacy and confidentiality policies of the organisation. Client
          names should be deleted, and financial figures or other personal
          details should be blacked out and made unidentifiable.

	<h1>Steps in the RPL process</h1>
	
	
	
	<div class="accordionItem close">
      <div class="accordionItemHeading"><i class="fas fa-suitcase"></i></i> <strong>Step 1: Provide information of your skills and experience: Portfolio of Evidence of your prior experience</strong></div>
      <div class="accordionItemContent">
          Complete this RPL Booklet (Candidate) 
		  and provide as much information of your previous experience in the 
		  Civil and Construction industry as you can. 
		  This is your first opportunity (and not the last) to provide proof of your variety of experience in the industry. Here you can supply examples of your 
		  work history which could include, but is not limited to:
			<br>		
		 <ul>
		<li>A current CV – it is very important this is current and includes tasks relevant to the units for which you are seeking RPL </li>
	<li>Copies of formal and informal training certificates/statements. i.e. Statements of attainment, Certificates, Certificates of Attendance/Participation in workplace education… </li>
	<li>Position Descriptions from previous/current roles</li>
	<li>Job References</li>
	<li>Examples of work documents</li>
	<li>Job contracts</li>
	<li>Documents displaying skills relevant to the units</li>
	<li>Videos demonstrating your skills</li>
	<li>Third party reports </li>
	<li>Observation checklist completed by a supervisor</li>
          </ul>

		  <strong>Please Note: </strong>
		  <ul>
		  	<li>All documents in languages other than English will need to be translated through a translating service into English at your own cost before submission. </li>
	<li>The verified documents must state that the person signing the document has sighted the original and verifies it is a true copy of the original. </li>
	<li>To assist you in your application, CWBTS has provided you with a copy of the unit/s of competency or reference to the training.gov.au website, where applicable. The Assessor will guide you through the process and supply their contact details for any additional support you may need in this stage of the process. </li>
	<li>You will also be required to provide contact details for at least one referee who can confirm your industry skills in context and over time. Your nominated contacts may be contacted by the Assessor to verify the information supplied</li>
	</ul>
	Depending on the company you have worked in, you may or may not have documentary evidence available. This should not deter you from seeking RPL as the Assessor will work with you during the RPL process.
	<br><br>
	You will also need to supply contact details of one or two work referees who can confirm your skills in the industry. (See Referee Form in this booklet)
	<br><br>
	Third-Party Evidence Reports may also be used as additional supplementary supporting evidence. This may be from a current or past supervisor/employer. Third-Party Evidence Reports will not be the sole manner of collecting evidence, but it does paint a picture to fill in gaps about your actual performance on the job, over time and in a range of conditions and situations. Your Assessor may witness you performing tasks only once and usually in a controlled environment; whereas the supervisor is likely to have directly observed you performing the task/s on many occasions over a period of weeks/months/years in a range of conditions, time constraints and other variables.
<br><br>
For currency, the third-party evidence must be recent and verifiable. This is achieved by containing a date, the employer/supervisor's name, contact details and position, the name of the company and how long they have known you. The Assessor reserves the right to verify any third-party evidence at any time to satisfy themselves that what is submitted is true and correct.

    </div>	
	
	<div class="accordionItem close">
      <div class="accordionItemHeading"><i class="fas fa-comments"></i> <strong>Step 2: Conversation with Assessor</strong></div>
      <div class="accordionItemContent">
 		An assessor will review the information you have provided (usually with you) and begin to match up your skills to the units/subjects in the qualification. At this point, you will have the opportunity to discuss and identify your previous experience with the assessor who will understand your industry experience and conduct a competency conversation with you. You will be required to answer building and construction or Civil industry related questions to identify your current skills. 
		<br><br>
		A summary of your responses to the questions asked in the initial and subsequent interviews will be documented by the Assessor. Responses to the competency conversation questions will also be documented and will form critical evidence for your assessment. Throughout the application process, you will be able to meet with the assessor more than once, if required, until the RPL assessment process is completed.
      </div>
    </div>
	
	<div class="accordionItem close">
      <div class="accordionItemHeading"><i class="fab fa-slideshare"></i></i> <strong>Step 3: Practical demonstration of your skills</strong></div>
      <div class="accordionItemContent">
The assessor will conduct a practical skills test at your workplace (if appropriate) or at another suitable venue. This, again, is an opportunity to demonstrate your level of competence. This assessment will be focussed on skills that are required in the qualification and will also be documented, against a checklist, as evidence supporting your application. Your assessor will identify the skills that they will want you to demonstrate in advance. You may also be asked a number of key questions relating to these practical skills you are demonstrating, thus allowing the assessor to gain an understanding of your underpinning knowledge.
      </div>
    </div>
	
	<div class="accordionItem close">
      <div class="accordionItemHeading"><i class="fas fa-search"></i> <strong>Step 4: Assessor analysis and judgement of the evidence against each unit of competency applied for. </strong></div>
      <div class="accordionItemContent">
On completion of the interview/s, portfolio of evidence, questions and discussions and practical assessment, the assessor will analyse all of the evidence against the benchmarks set in each unit of competence you are applying for and make a judgement of the level of succuss of your application.
      </div>
    </div>
	
		<div class="accordionItem close">
      <div class="accordionItemHeading"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> <strong>Step 5: Communication of results (success) of the application</strong></div>
      <div class="accordionItemContent">
The RPL assessor will be in contact with you to communicate the findings and subsequent results of your application. This will also be followed up in writing and sent to you. This open communication enables discussion of the assessment result and explanation of the assessment rationale. 
        <br><br>
If the application is rejected, the process enables you to discuss any grounds for an appeal which you may wish to present. You may request further assessment, re-apply providing additional information and evidence or appeal the decision, via the complaints and appeals process.
		  <br><br>
For a successful assessment, the results are provided to Student Data Team to update the Student Management System with the final result towards the qualification or a qualification issued (if the application related to a full qualification) or Statement of Attainment issued if for one or more units of competence, but not a full qualification.
 <br><br>
 The RPL application, copies of evidence, supporting documentation and final results are placed on your file and retained in accordance with the RTOs Guidelines for Student Records Policy and Procedure.
 <br><br>
 If skills gaps have been identified, these may be addressed through flexible training.
 <br><br>
 This RPL process has been developed to streamline an application for Recognition of Prior Learning.
